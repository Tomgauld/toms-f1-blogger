      <strong>What is DAS good for?</strong>
      <p>DAS (Or Dual Access Steering) is a new innovation from Mercedes in 2020. It is a new legal F1 innovation within the new Mercedes Formula 1 car. It works by having the driver pull the steering wheel towards themselves, which changes the toe angle from the front tyres from them being outward (from around 1-2 degrees), to straightening them forward. This has many benefits. When doing this, the drivers MFD on the steering wheel projects the word: “MARKER”.

      Mercedes DAS (Dual Axis Steering) has many benefits.
      Grip and aero benefits:
      <br>
      <br>
      • Can slow down tyre wear on the straights since the toe or the tyres point straight forward instead of 2 degrees outwards, in which the tyres lose grip since the connection from the tyre to the surface is going outwards, which creates more tyre wear since is going side on, DAS therefore helps with this since it points the tyres forward and removes the factor of losing front tyre grip through the straights
      <br>
      <br>
      • Also, the toe being straight helps with aerodynamic slipperiness over the front tyres, since the air going over the tyres  slips straight to the rear wheels without being disrupted, since there is no different direction for the wind to cut off to when DAS is enabled, meaning that since the wheels will be facing head on, the air is less interfered, which may help with the aerodynamics of the front wheels 
      <br>
      <br>
      • You may get slightly more amount of tyre touching the surface of the track on the straight when DAS is enabled, since the toe being put straight of the wheels makes it so that the compound is flatter than having it about 2 degrees outwards
      <br>
      <br>
      Cooling benefits:
      • Without DAS, the front tyres generate a lot of heat within the sidepods and air vents of the front tyres, due to heat being created next to the tyres whilst going through straights. This is because with the toe of the tyres being out by 2 degrees then unwanted heat can travel and bypass through these slots next to the tyres, which would create more unwanted heat to the brakes, vents and tyres. DAS therefore helps by venting the heat through the car without catching it within the sidepods. 
      <br>
      <br>
      • DAS will also help with front tyre cooling, something that Mercedes has issues with last year, noticeably also at Austria 2019, 2018 and 2017. DAS is an improvement here as well, since if the tyres point straight then they will generate less heat since there is no grip being wasted on the straight with the toe of the tyres being outwards, therefore generating more heat unnecessarily and therefore being able to be used in different places, like upcoming corners
