			<h2>Germany 2020</h2>
			<p class="germany2020">
				<strong>It is the 12th of October</strong>, the day after the German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, in which F1 has not been at since 2012, and overall I would say the race was pretty good. Bottas started on pole but had a lousy start compared to Hamilton, who got a good run into Bottas into turn 1 and almost passed him, until Bottas was able to get back past lewis into turn 2. We saw Lando Norris having engine problems halfway through the race and eventually ended up retiring later on. Bottas also had engine problems after locking up into turn 1 and enabling Hamilton to gain the position on him, Bottas later on retired with an engine issue. Many cars yesterday retired with reliability issues, and I believe it is due to having the cancellation of FP1  and FP2 due to rain, continuing the opninon of removing FP1 and FP2 off of race weekends, (in which I am in favour of). However, it was Lewis who won at the end of the day, and therefore he manages to match Michael Schumacher's record of 91 race wins.

			<h2>Italy 2019</h2>
			<p class="italy2019">
				<strong>It is Sunday 8th of September</strong>, a couple hours after the Italian Grand Prix, in which I would class one of the best Italian Grand Prix's we have seen for a while. Through FP1, FP2, FP3 and Qualifying it was looked dominant from Ferrari due to the large amount of straits on the circuit and having the track better suited to fit their car, Ferrari undoubtabely dominating the entire weekend. The Tifosi were looking strong as ever with the sea of red being cast throughout Monza. Charles Leclerc set off the race from Pole position with a good start, fending off Hamilton and Vettel into turn 1. Max Verstappen had an interesting move into turn 1 with Max being careful from not rearending one of the Racing Point cars, as his brakes were evidently cold, making him have a minor incident making him go off into the run-off area, in which Romain Grosjean joined him, with some midfield team turn 1 carnage. Inevitabley the weekend was rounded off by a fantastic win from Charles leclerc, and a dissapointed and underwhelming Sebastian Vettel, who spun out and collided with Lance Stroll whilst trying to come back onto the track. We look onto 2 weeks ahead for a action packed Singapore grand prix that is looking postive to deliver.

			<h2>Belgium 2019</h2>
			<p class ="belgium2019">
				<strong>It is Tuesday, September the 3rd</strong>, a couple days after the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix, and my goodness we had a thriller of a race on our hands. Lets begin with Ferrari. The biggest reason for their success on tracks like Spa, Monza and Circuit Gilles-Villneuve is due to its sensational straight line speed thanks to its Power Unit. The Ferrari however lacks the cornering speeds compared to the likes of the Red Bull and Mercedes. Charles Leclerc had the pressure from Hamilton towards the end of the race due to Ferrari's long game choice in strategy. Weather throughout the weekend seemed to be track optimal with no forecasted rain and no need to switch to intermidiates. We also had some great last lap carnage as Lando Norris because another retiree on the weekend due to an engine failure on the last lap, laps before this Lando was indeed reporting over the radio a loss of power from one of the Motor Generators in the engine. Another similar retirement due to engine failure this week was Robert Kubica in the Williams, as the car blew huge fumes of smoke out of the exhaust, a strange thing to happen to one of the Mercedes engines. To round off the weekend we all payed tribute to the passing of Forumla 2 driver Antoine Hubert who suffered a fatal crash in the Formula 2 sprint race. Other F1 drivers who were friends of Antione's such as Charles Leclerc, Pierre Gasly and Estaban Ocon all payed their tributes, alongside the fans at Spa who all clapped on lap 17 in the Formula 1 Race, as Antione's race number was 17. We rejoin F1 in just a weeks time in Monza, another week for Ferrari to shine.
